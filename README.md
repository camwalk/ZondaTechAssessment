## Running the application

Ensure 'npm install' has been run in both the web and api folders.
Simply run 'npm start' in the web folder, and 'node app.js' in the api folder.

## Running tests

For testing the React application run 'npm test' in the web folder, and for testing the API do the same in the api folder.
